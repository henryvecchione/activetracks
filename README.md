# ActiveTracks
### (formerly "Strotify") 

ActiveTracks prints what you listened to on Spotify during a Strava activity to its description. It uses the Spotify and Strava developer APIs to get the data.

Limitations:
- ActiveTracks may not work if the Strava user's account is private
- The Spotify API only returns the last 50 songs, so songs can't be pulled for old activities
